## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj`
file in RStudio - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). - finally, open
`analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run
`rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console

### Personal Notes

-   If I get to do another round of this survey, then I might make some
    changes to the format
    -   I would put the question ‘Please mark any means of
        transportation you use to get to work, school, shopping, or any
        other places you need to visit…’ before any other mode questions
        and have it eliminate the other modes from future questions
        about modes for the respondents so they don’t have to do it
        repeatedly
